            As I reach the end of machine learning module, I look back at the last three months that I spent gaining
            knowledge about how machine learning can be used in real world applications and how to train and validate
            data for different machine learning models.</p>
          <p
            style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'>
            The first assignment we had was to perform Exploratory data analytics on an Airbnb New York dataset
            (Kaggle,2019). Preprocessing such as removing irrelevant columns was performed to make sure the data matched
            the business question, <span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>how do factors such as neighborhood,
              room type, and pricing affect the dynamics of Airbnb listings in New York City?</span></p>
          <p
            style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'>
            <span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>My role in the team was to do data visualization to check
              how the listed properties were scattered across New York. Our teamwork was highly efficient. We had at
              least two weekly meetings, sometimes even extending to three. Every member almost always attended the
              meeting on time, and we were able to comfortably complete the assignment with no last-minute rushes
              required.&nbsp;</span>
          </p>
          <p
            style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'>
            <span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>The second assignment was an individual assignment to use
              CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to analyze CIFAR-10 dataset. During this assignment, I learnt about
              different layers and their activation functions. This assignment helped me greatly understand how to
              optimize models by tuning the epochs and learning rate of the model. It also taught me how to look for
              problems such as overfitting and how we can use dropout layers to help minimize the impact on the
              model.</span>
          </p>
          <p
            style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'>
            <span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>During the module we had two collaborative discussions.
              First was about the fourth industrial revolution by Schwab (2016). I wrote about how fast technology was
              evolving and highlighted the impact of how failures of technology can have devastating consequences.
              &nbsp;I used the example of the Boeing 737 max incidents which was caused by the MCAS (</span>Maneuver
            Characteristics Augmentation System)<span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>&nbsp;being fed data
              from faulty sensors. This caused significant damage to Boeing&rsquo;s reputation, and they had to pay
              billions of dollars in fines.&nbsp;</span>(Holeman, 2020).
          </p>
          <p
            style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'>
            The second discussion was about the rise and risks of language-generating AI by Hutson (2021). In this
            discussion I wrote about LLM&rsquo;s (Large language models) about fast they are growing and highlighted
            some concerns such as social biases which can lead to misinformation (Chaudhary et al., 2024) and the fact
            that LLM&rsquo;s cannot explain their decision-making process (Ufuk, 2023) which affects industries such as
            healthcare and finance, where accountability is required.</p>
          <p
            style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'>
            <span style='font-family:"Calibri",sans-serif;'>I also mentioned a few methods where the social bias issue
              can be resolved such as&nbsp;</span>Quantitative Certification of Bias by Chaudhary et al. (2024).
          </p>
          <p
            style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'>
            Overall, it&rsquo;s been a great learning experience. The knowledge I gained about EDA process and how to
            filter irrelevant data out will significantly ease my future projects to make sure only relevant data is
            passed and to check if the data is biased or not. I have learnt about neural networks and how to optimize
            them to make them useful which I can use in future projects such as image classifications.</p>
          <p
            style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:0in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:0in;line-height:115%;font-size:16px;font-family:"Aptos",sans-serif;'>
            On an individual level, I have improved on how to become a good team member and have productive discussions
            with teammates. I have also learnt about time management with teams from different time zones and how to
            communicate effectively to ensure the work is done before the deadline.</p>
